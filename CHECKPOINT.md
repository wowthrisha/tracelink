# Checkpoint — V14.0 Owner Mode Sprint

Running state snapshot, updated after every closed backlog item. See `PROGRESS.md` for the narrative log and `ENGINEERING_BACKLOG.md` for full issue detail.

**Last updated**: 2026-07-26, after ENG-003.

## Environment state

- Local Docker stack is **up** (`docker compose up --build -d`) — Postgres 16, Redis 7, API, worker, beat, all healthy. Used for browser-verifying every fix before it's considered done, without touching the production Railway deployment. Same Supabase auth project as production; separate local database — no production data at risk.
- All code changes so far are **local, uncommitted**. Per this session's standing git policy (never commit/push without explicit request — `origin/main` auto-deploys to the live Railway production instance), fixes are being committed locally as they close (for `FIX_COMPLETION_MATRIX.md`'s commit-hash field) but **not pushed** without separate explicit confirmation.
- Backend test baseline: 1708 passed, 1 skipped. Frontend test baseline: 13/13 passed. Both re-confirmed unchanged after ENG-001.

## Backlog status (see ENGINEERING_BACKLOG.md for full detail)

| ID | Status |
|---|---|
| ENG-001 | **Closed** — Analytics grid overflow fixed, verified, zero regressions |
| ENG-002 | **Closed** — Notifications feed now shows document name + page number, verified live, zero regressions |
| ENG-003 | **Closed — no defect found.** Cross-account IDOR verified live with a genuine second account; every attempt correctly blocked. New low-priority finding ENG-021 logged (link 403 vs 404 inconsistency). |
| ENG-004 | Next up |
| ENG-005 – ENG-021 | Open, per priority order in `ENGINEERING_BACKLOG.md` |

## Immediate next step

ENG-004 (document picker can't disambiguate duplicate filenames) — small, additive frontend change, low regression risk.

## Disposable test accounts created this sprint (local stack only)

- `eng003.idor.test2@mailinator.com` — Account B for ENG-003's IDOR test. Confirmed, logged in, holds zero real resources. Local database only, does not exist in production.

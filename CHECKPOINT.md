# Checkpoint — V14.0 Owner Mode Sprint

Running state snapshot, updated after every closed backlog item. See `PROGRESS.md` for the narrative log and `ENGINEERING_BACKLOG.md` for full issue detail.

**Last updated**: 2026-07-27 08:45, after ENG-008.

## Burndown

| Priority | Total | Closed | Remaining |
|---|---|---|---|
| Critical | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| High | 3 | 3 | 0 |
| Medium | 3 | 2 | 1* |
| Low | 7 | 2 | 5 |
| Enhancement | 8 | 0 | 8 |
| **Total** | **21** | **7** | **14** |

\* ENG-005 remains counted as open/deferred (pagination itself not built), but its deferral was actively re-confirmed this sprint, not silently skipped — see `PROGRESS.md`.

Overall completion: **33.3%** (7/21). See `PROGRESS.md` for the full dashboard (current/previous/next issue, regression status, test status, commit hash, blocker, ETA).

## V15.0 process refinements now in effect

- Commit format: `fix(ENG-###): concise description`
- After every issue: full regression sweep now includes build + migration validation + repo-wide grep for TODO/FIXME/console.log/debugger/print()/unused imports, in addition to the existing test-suite + browser-verification routine
- Backlog file paths are verified against the real repo before editing (ENG-007's originally-guessed file was wrong; corrected before implementation, not after)

## Environment state

- Local Docker stack is **up** (`docker compose up --build -d`) — Postgres 16, Redis 7, API, worker, beat, all healthy. Used for browser-verifying every fix before it's considered done, without touching the production Railway deployment. Same Supabase auth project as production; separate local database — no production data at risk.
- All code changes so far are **local, uncommitted**. Per this session's standing git policy (never commit/push without explicit request — `origin/main` auto-deploys to the live Railway production instance), fixes are being committed locally as they close (for `FIX_COMPLETION_MATRIX.md`'s commit-hash field) but **not pushed** without separate explicit confirmation.
- Backend test baseline: 1708 passed, 1 skipped. Frontend test baseline: 13/13 passed. Both re-confirmed unchanged after ENG-001.

## Backlog status (see ENGINEERING_BACKLOG.md for full detail)

| ID | Status |
|---|---|
| ENG-001 | **Closed** — Analytics grid overflow fixed, verified, zero regressions |
| ENG-002 | **Closed** — Notifications feed now shows document name + page number, verified live, zero regressions |
| ENG-003 | **Closed — no defect found.** Cross-account IDOR verified live with a genuine second account; every attempt correctly blocked. New low-priority finding ENG-021 logged (link 403 vs 404 inconsistency). |
| ENG-004 | Next up |
| ENG-005 – ENG-021 | Open, per priority order in `ENGINEERING_BACKLOG.md` |

## Immediate next step

ENG-009 (XSS testing beyond link labels) — bounded live test, reuse the same payload pattern already proven safe for link labels against the remaining untested fields (document filenames, org names, webhook descriptions, API key names). Per explicit process rule: if any issue uncovers a broader architectural problem, pause it, document the finding, add it to `ENGINEERING_BACKLOG.md` with a dependency link, and move to the next independent item rather than getting stuck.

## Disposable test accounts created this sprint (local stack only)

- `eng003.idor.test2@mailinator.com` — Account B for ENG-003's IDOR test. Confirmed, logged in, holds zero real resources. Local database only, does not exist in production.
